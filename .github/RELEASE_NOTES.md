**Unofficial test build of USB Loader GX with native Riivolution support.**
Not from the upstream wiidev team — do not report problems with it to them.

## Install

Unzip at the root of your SD card. It lands in `/apps/usbloader_gx/` and appears in the
Homebrew Channel as *USB Loader GX Riivolution*. It reads the same config files as stock
USB Loader GX, so your settings, game list and covers are untouched.

## Using it

Put the mod on your SD card the way its author describes, then: game cover →
**Settings** → **Riivolution**, pick the XML, set the options, **Save**, launch.
Choices are stored per game.

Needs AHBPROT — launch from the Homebrew Channel directly, not from a forwarder.

`<memory>`, `<savegame>` and the option menus work. `<file>`/`<folder>` replacement is
attempted from v1.0: if any check fails, nothing is applied and the game boots
untouched.

Every launch writes a report next to the XML you picked —
`<device>:/riivolution/usbloadergx_riivo.log`. Please attach it to any report.

## Changed in v2.7

- Every mod file is now read back off the disc, not a sample of them.
- Read-back failures are listed together instead of stopping at the first.
- The log records the game's entry point and arena bounds at hand-over.
- Create `<device>:/riivolution/nomempatch.txt` to install the files without the `<memory>` patches.
- 137,854 automated checks, all passing.
