**Unofficial test build of USB Loader GX with native Riivolution support.**
Not from the upstream wiidev team — do not report problems with it to them.

## Install

Unzip at the root of your SD card. It lands in `/apps/usbloader_gx/` and appears in the
Homebrew Channel as *USB Loader GX Riivolution*. It reads the same config files as stock
USB Loader GX, so your settings, game list and covers are untouched.

## Using it

Put the mod on your SD card the way its author describes, then: game cover →
**Settings** → **Riivolution**, pick the XML, set the options, **Save**, launch.
Choices are stored per game.

The mod's files must be on the same drive as the game. USB game, USB mod; SD game,
SD mod. Mixing them is refused, because the cIOS reads every fragment from one drive.

Needs AHBPROT — launch from the Homebrew Channel directly, not from a forwarder.

`<memory>`, `<savegame>` and the option menus work. `<file>`/`<folder>` replacement is
attempted from v1.0: if any check fails, nothing is applied and the game boots
untouched.

Every launch writes a report next to the XML you picked —
`<device>:/riivolution/usbloadergx_riivo.log`. Please attach it to any report.

## Changed in v3.2

- The rebuilt file table is written into the game's memory as the very last step before the game starts, instead of just after the apploader runs.
- The screen turns white immediately before the game is started. If it stays white, the loader finished its work and the game itself did not start. If it stays black, the loader did not get that far. Please say which you saw.
- A progress bar covers the slow parts of a Riivolution boot; the log records each boot step as it completes.
- 146,237 automated checks, all passing.
